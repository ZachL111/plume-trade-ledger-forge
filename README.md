# plume-trade-ledger-forge

`plume-trade-ledger-forge` packages a practical trading systems exercise in Zig. The emphasis is on deterministic behavior, a small public API, and examples that explain the tradeoffs.

## How I Read Plume Trade Ledger Forge

The useful thing to inspect here is how the same score rule is represented in code, metadata, and examples. If those three pieces disagree, the audit script should make the drift visible.

## Main Behaviors

- Includes extended examples for fills, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents portfolio pressure tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Problem Shape

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## Repository Map

- `src`: primary implementation
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Internal Model

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The Zig version uses compile-time constants and native test blocks for fast local checks.

## How To Run It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Scenario Walkthrough

The examples are meant to be readable before they are exhaustive. They cover enough variation to show how latency and risk can pull a decision below the threshold.

## Validation

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Known Edges

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Follow-Up Work

- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add one more trading systems fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Run It Locally

The only required setup is the local Zig toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.
